\section{Data set}\label{sec:data}

Modern financial markets, are organized as a double continuous auctions. Agents
can place different types of orders to buy or to sell a given number of shares,
roughly categorized as market orders and limit orders.

Market orders are execute at the best available buy or sell price, limit orders
set a maximum purchase price for a buy order, or a minimum sale price for a
sell order. If the limit price is not matched, the order will not be carried
out
\cite{large_prices_changes,predictive_pow,intro_market_micro,stat_theory}.
Limit orders often fail to result in an immediate transaction, and are stored
in a queue called the limit order book
\cite{stat_prop,predictive_pow,intro_market_micro,prop_order_book}. The order
book also identifies the market participants behind the buy and sell orders,
although some choose to remain anonymous. The order book is visible for all
traders and its main purpose is to ensure that all traders have the same
information on what is offered on the market. The order book is the ultimate
microscopic level of description of financial markets.

Buy limit orders are called ``bids", and sell limit orders are called ``asks".
At any given time there is a best (lowest) offer to sell with price
$a\left(t\right)$, and a best (highest) bid to buy with price $b\left(t\right)$
\cite{subtle_nature,account_spread,limit_ord_spread,prop_order_book,stat_theory}.
The price gap between them is called the spread
$s\left(t\right) = a\left(t\right)-b\left(t\right)$
\cite{subtle_nature,market_digest,Bouchaud_2004,account_spread,em_stylized_facts,large_prices_changes,stat_theory}.
Spreads are significantly positively related to price and significantly
negatively related to trading volume. Companies with more liquidity tend to
have lower spreads
\cite{components_spread_tokyo,effects_spread,account_spread,components_spread}.

In this study, we analyzed trades and quotes (TAQ) data from the NASDAQ stock
market. We selected NASDAQ because it is an electronic exchange where stocks
are traded through an automated network of computers instead of a trading
floor, which makes trading more efficient, fast and accurate. Furthermore,
NASDAQ is the second largest stock exchange based on market capitalization
in the world.

In the TAQ data set, there are two data files for each stock. One gives the
list of all successive quotes. Thus, we have the best bid price, best ask
price, available volume and the time stamp accurate to the second. The other
data file is the list of all successive trades, with the traded price, traded
volume and time stamp accurate to the second. Despite the one second accuracy
of the time stamps, in both files more than one quote or trade may be recorded
in the same second.

Due to the the time stamp accuracy, it is not possible to match each trade with
the directly preceding quote. Hence, we cannot determine the trade sign by
comparing the traded price and the preceding midpoint price
\cite{Wang_2016_cross}. We have to preprocess the data to relate the midpoint
prices with the trade signs in trade time scale and in physical time scale.

To analyze the response functions across different stocks in Sects.
\ref{sec:response_functions_imp}, \ref{sec:time_shift} and
\ref{sec:short_long}, we select the six companies with the largest average
market capitalization (AMC) in three economic sectors of the S\&P index in
2008. Table \ref{tab:companies} shows the companies analyzed with their
corresponding symbol and sector, and three average values for a year.

To analyze the spread impact in response functions (Sect.
\ref{sec:spread_impact}), we select 524 stocks in the NASDAQ stock market for
the year 2008. The selected stocks are listed in Appendix
\ref{app:spread_impact}.

In order to avoid overnight effects and any artifact due to the opening and
closing of the market, we systematically discard the first ten and the last
ten minutes of trading in a given day
\cite{Bouchaud_2004,large_prices_changes,spread_changes_affect,Wang_2016_cross}.
Therefore, we only consider trades of the same day from 9:40:00 to 15:50:00
New York local time. We will refer to this interval of time as the ``market
time". The year 2008 corresponds to 253 bussiness days.
