TAQ Responses Time Short Long
=============================

The objective of this part of the code is to test how is the influence of a
short and long response in the self- and cross responses for different
:math:`\tau` values with a :math:`\tau'` as the short response in time scale.

The code is divided in four parts:
    * `Tools`_: some functions for repetitive actions.
    * `Analysis`_: code to analyze the data.
    * `Plot`_: code to plot the data.
    * `Main`_: code to run the implementation.
