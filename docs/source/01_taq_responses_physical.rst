TAQ Responses Physical
**********************

The objective of this part of the code is to reproduce the sections 3.1 and 3.2
of the paper `Crossâ€“response in correlated financial markets:  individual
stocks
<https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjb/e2016-60818-y.pdf>`_.

All the results obtained with the **TAQ Responses Physical** modules are the
base to the other implementations (TAQ Physical Shift, TAQ Responses Physical
Shift, TAQ Responses Activity and TAQ Responses Physical Short Long).

Run the code
============

To run the code, please follow the instructions of the README.md in the
`GitHub <https://github.com/juanhenao21/response_functions_year>`_ repository.

Modules
=======
The code is divided in four parts:
    * `Tools`_: some functions for repetitive actions.
    * `Analysis`_: code to analyze the data.
    * `Plot`_: code to plot the data.
    * `Main`_: code to run the implementation.
