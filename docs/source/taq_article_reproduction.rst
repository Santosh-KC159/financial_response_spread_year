TAQ Article Reproduction
========================

The objective of this part of the code is to reproduce the part III.A and III.B
of the paper `Crossâ€“response in correlated financial markets:  individual
stocks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01580.pdf>`_.

# Explain this is the fundamental part of the code and that it should be run
# before the others part to have the corresponding data

The code is divided in four parts:
    * `Tools`_: some functions for repetitive actions.
    * `Analysis`_: code to analyze the data.
    * `Plot`_: code to plot the data.
    * `Main`_: code to run the implementation.
