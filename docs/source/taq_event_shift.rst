The objective of this part of the code is to test what are the results of use
different event shifts between the returns and the trade signs.

# Write what parts of the previous code does this implementation needs.

The code is divided in four parts:
    * `Tools`_: some functions for repetitive actions.
    * `Analysis`_: code to analyze the data.
    * `Plot`_: code to plot the data.
    * `Main`_: code to run the implementation.
